# Swire Capstone: Customer Growth Modeling
# ----------------------------------------
# This repo contains my personal work for the Swire Coca Cola Capstone Project (Spring 2025, Group 2)

# The goal of this work was to utilize Swire's customer data to enhance systematic approaches to identifying and classifying potential/emerging customers that are reaching key volume thresholds. With this identification SWIRE would be able to ensure they are not moving future profitable customers to alternate route to market, and ensure they continue to grow through SWIRE's internal delivery service.

# FILE OVERVIEW
# -------------------------
# - Multiple files store the work related to EDA, key findings I had here were: the poor distribution of white truck vs red truck customers, customers fell into a few distinct locational segments, there was vast variation with customer traits like cold drink channell and local market partner status. 

# - Multiple files reflect various modeling work related to identifying red/white truck customers. There were some challenges faced with identifying significant and important features, the high order variation made it difficult to pinpoint customer features that led to high order volumes.
