# Swire Capstone: Customer Growth Modeling
This repo contains my personal work for the Swire Coca-Cola Capstone Project (Spring 2025, Group 2 - University of Utah MSBA Program).

The goal of this project was to utilize Swire’s customer data to develop a systematic method  to identify and classify threshold or emerging customers who are approaching key volume thresholds. The primary objective was to ensure that future high volume customers are not prematurely shifted to an alternate route to market (white truck), and instead are supported to grow through Swire’s internal red truck delivery service.

# FILE OVERVIEW

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
 Key findings included:
 - Uneven distribution between red truck and white truck customers
 - Customers tended to fall into a few clear geographic clusters
 - Substantial variation in traits such as cold drink channel status and local market partner designation

# Modeling Work:
• Multiple RMarkdown files document my attempts to predict which customers will cross the 400-gallon threshold in 2024
• I explored both GLMs and multilevel models (with random effects by segment or retailer)
• A key challenge was the wide variation in order volumes, which made it difficult to isolate consistently predictive features
• Segmenting customers by retailer and performance group helped improve model fit

# NOTES

This repo reflects my individual contributions and experimentation outside the final team deliverables. It includes trial runs, personal notes, and versions of models I tested on my own. 

For the final presentation and group work, refer to the separate project submission files.
